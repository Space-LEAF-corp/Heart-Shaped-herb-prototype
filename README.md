# DNA Cohesion Simulation

This repository simulates node and edge failures in a graph representing DNA/protein structures under environmental stress.

## Features
- Node classification (`ANCHOR`, `HUB`, `RNA`, etc.)
- Environmental load with Flexium shielding
- Yearly step simulation with cascading failures
- RNA-mediated bond repair
- 100-year simulation runner

## Installation
Clone the repo and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourname/dna-cohesion-sim.git
cd dna-cohesion-sim
pip install -r requirements.txt
